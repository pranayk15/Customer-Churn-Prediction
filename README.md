# Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and other features, the model helps businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn refers to customers stopping their use of a company’s service. Predicting churn accurately helps businesses reduce revenue loss by identifying at-risk customers and taking preventive actions.

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as demographic details, account info, usage patterns, and churn labels.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
    cd customer-churn-prediction
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    - Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then open `churn_prediction.ipynb`.
